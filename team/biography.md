      I am interested about biological process simulations, and I want to learn any related knowledge and technologies. On the side, I like reading, watching movies (some cartoons are very appealing to me, such as One Piece, Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, etc.),  and traveling. I think I am good at drawing, and I guess I may have some kind of talents at designing. Oh, I also like sports, for example, basketball, table tennis, badminton and tennis. When I graduate, I want to continue my research and and to try out many other things.

      Having had my undergraduate training in chemistry and research experience in protein biochemistry, I now find myself writing codes and watching the proteins dance. My current growing research interest lies in the functional dynamics of biomolecules. Apart from making delicious dishes such as Western Blots, I like to read non-fiction articles from the Economist and FiveThirtyEight.

      Hello! My name is Ananya and I am an avid traveller, glitter aficionado, and aspiring UofT graduate student from Mississauga, Ontario. I received my BSc from Bishop’s University where I studied honours chemistry with a minor in classical music. I am a recovering technophobe fascinated by the endless possibilities of computational chemistry, and I hope to complete my graduate studies in this field. I love meeting new people, making bad chemistry jokes (because all the good ones argon), and taking long walks on the beach.

      Hey! I'm currently pursuing a MSc in the Biochemistry department at the University of Toronto, and joined the Pomès lab to learn how to use computational techniques and simulations to study biological systems. I'm originally from Scarborough and got my BSc from McMaster University. I graduated from their Biochemistry Co-op program, working at the IRCM in Montréal and science writing positions here and in Ottawa before rediscovering that I still love living in Toronto the most. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking to tall places, reading about psychology, owning too many plants, and falling off my bike.
