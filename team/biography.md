      Hello~~~ I’m a PhD student in the Biochemistry Department. I’m from China. I have been studying the structure and function of membrane proteins. I like reading, watching anime, Netflix, sleeping, and swimming. More importantly, I like eating cheap but decent food; lying in bed while emptying my mind; staring at the lake and skyscraper from the lab; killing time by counting the number of cars on the street from PGCRL (21st). More and more importantly, I often spend lots of time dreaming about my future.

      Having had my undergraduate training in chemistry and research experience in protein biochemistry, I now find myself writing codes and watching the proteins dance. My current growing research interest lies in the functional dynamics of biomolecules. Apart from making delicious dishes such as Western Blots, I like to read non-fiction articles from the Economist and FiveThirtyEight.

      Hello! My name is Ananya and I am an avid traveller, glitter aficionado, and aspiring UofT graduate student from Mississauga, Ontario. I received my BSc from Bishop’s University where I studied honours chemistry with a minor in classical music. I am a recovering technophobe fascinated by the endless possibilities of computational chemistry, and I hope to complete my graduate studies in this field. I love meeting new people, making bad chemistry jokes (because all the good ones argon), and taking long walks on the beach.

      Hey! I'm currently pursuing a MSc in the Biochemistry department at the University of Toronto, and joined the Pomès lab to learn how to use computational techniques and simulations to study biological systems. I'm originally from Scarborough and got my BSc from McMaster University. I graduated from their Biochemistry Co-op program, working at the IRCM in Montréal and science writing positions here and in Ottawa before rediscovering that I still love living in Toronto the most. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking to tall places, reading about psychology, owning too many plants, and falling off my bike.

      Hello and welcome to our lab! I did my undergrad at McMaster in biochemistry and having been unsure of my career, I wanted to try something completely different; which is why I joined a computer simulation lab. Currently, I am hoping to join a biotech/pharmaceutical company in California after my graduate studies. I may or may not be a little obsessed with Paris (spot the 7 Eiffel Tower stuff if you ever come by my desk), tiramisu, creme brulee and gory murder mystery books!

      Bonjour! I completed my BSc at the University of Toronto specializing in Biochemistry. Despite my academic background, I am computer enthusiast who is interested contributing to serveral research fields by applying computational tools. In my spare time, you can find me starting new computer-related projects, playing video games, upgrading my personal computer rig, or running by the lake as the sun rises.
